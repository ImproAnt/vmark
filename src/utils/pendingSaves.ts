/**
 * Pending Saves Tracker (Content-Based)
 *
 * Tracks the exact content being written to files to enable reliable
 * detection of our own saves vs external modifications.
 *
 * This is a content-based approach that eliminates race conditions:
 * - Stores the exact content we're about to write
 * - On file watcher event, compare disk content to pending content
 * - If they match, it's our save (regardless of timing)
 *
 * Usage:
 * 1. Call registerPendingSave(path, content) BEFORE writeTextFile()
 * 2. Call clearPendingSave(path) AFTER markSaved()
 * 3. Use matchesPendingSave(path, diskContent) to check if disk matches what we wrote
